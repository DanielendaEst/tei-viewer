Mobile Responsive Branch - Summary
===================================

Branch: mobile-responsive-design

CHANGES:
--------
1. Fixed overlapping panels on mobile/small screens
   - Changed from fixed height to max-height on containers
   - Used flex: 1 1 auto instead of flex: 1 for better flexibility
   - Image panels now use flex: 0 0 auto to prevent unwanted expansion
   - Added proper min-height constraints (200px-300px)

2. Improved responsive breakpoints
   - 1200px: Tablet layout (vertical stack)
   - 900px: Small tablet (full-width selectors)
   - 768px: Mobile (compact, touch-friendly)
   - 480px: Extra small mobile

3. Touch optimizations
   - 44px minimum button height
   - Better tap targets
   - Momentum scrolling
   - No horizontal overflow

TESTING:
--------
trunk serve --port 8080
Then resize browser or use DevTools responsive mode

ISSUES FIXED:
-------------
✓ Panels no longer overlap when screen is reduced
✓ Content stacks vertically on narrow screens
✓ No fixed positioning causing layout breaks
✓ Proper scrolling when content overflows
